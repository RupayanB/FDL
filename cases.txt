File Manipulation Language

Use Cases
1.) I wish to organize my pictures by date. I should be a able to write a program that can pickup all .jpg in a folder and create new folders by date and save copies in the respective folder.
The above organization also applies to normal word files so that I can see all the version chronologically arranged and not have to append dates/versions to their names.

2.) Suppose we are a group of friends who need to share pictures amongst ourselves. I take copies from all my friends but they have already exchanged and so duplicate pictures exist.
I should be able to write a program that deletes the duplicates and copies all the distinct photos to a folder.
Or maybe just get a list of repeated photos and the delete the ones I want.

The above scenario holds for movies, songs and other such files people typically share.

3.) Suppose i have labelled all my songs by their genres and now I want to create separate folders out of them.
I should be able to write a program that identifies the file genres and copy them into their respective folders.

Similar application for movies.

4.)
