FDL (pronounced "fiddle") or File and Directory Manipulation Language allows users to write short and intuitive programs to better organize and manage the data on their computers. 

Here is a sample of things you can do with simple fiddle programs:
-Remove file duplicates from multiple folders
-Clear up your desktop clutter by automatically organizing files into separate folders based on file types
-Rename all those images you donwloaded from your phone in one go
-Bulk delete files that only match certain criteria
-Copy/Move files between mutiples folders at once
and much more!

For a brief tutorial and the language reference manual, refer to FDL.pdf in the doc folder.

FDL was developed by Rupayan Basu, Pranav Bhalla, Cara Borenstein, Daniel Garzon and Daniel Newman at Columbia University in 2013.
